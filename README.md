# FingerPaintVR

Work in progress finger painting app. Tracks pinch detection to allow for control over color and brush width and working on creating custom gesture controls.

Currently (immaturely) have the middle finger mapped to erasing all work.

I've recorded custom gestures for thumbs up and down 👍👎, finger guns 👉👆, the peace sign ✌️ and the rockout sign 🤘, and should have them implemented as controls soon. Will also upload the rest of the project file shortly as well as an .apk file for Quest sideloading.
